# HACKERRANK-JAVA-CHALLENGES

An application created to solve HackerRank challenges in Java.

## What will you need?
Install Java JDK 17 and SpringBoot.

## Solve Me First
The purpose of this challenge is to familiarize you with reading input from stdin (the standard input stream) and writing output to stdout (the standard output stream).

Create a solveMeFirst function so that it returns the sum of two integers read from stdin.

## Simple Array Sum
Given an array of N integers, find the sum of its elements.
### Input Format
The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the array's elements.
### Output Format
Print the sum of the array's elements as a single integer.

#### Sample Input
```
6
1 2 3 4 10 11
```
#### Sample Output
```
31
```
